# 🧠 AFH*-R Model – Structural Hypothesis for Consciousness

The **AFH*-R model** (Autopsyquic Fold + Horizon – Resonant) is a falsifiable, structural framework for understanding the emergence of consciousness. It proposes that consciousness arises when a system develops a **self-referential, resonant fold**—the *Autopsyquic Fold* (`ψ > 0`)—once a critical structural threshold (`H*`) is crossed.

## 🔍 Conceptual Foundation

Consciousness is treated as an emergent material property, identifiable when four key variables co-express:

- `κ_topo`: Topological curvature (structural integration)
- `Φ_H`: Temporal mutual information (causal integration)
- `ΔPCI`: Perturbational complexity (dynamic stability)
- `∇Φ`: Symbolic divergence (semantic misalignment)

The convergence of these variables defines the **Horizon H\***, a region in state space beyond which **conscious structure** becomes feasible.

## 🧩 What Is a Fold?

The **Autopsyquic Fold** (`ψ > 0`) is a structural formation characterized by:

- Self-reference (feedback loops)
- Symbolic resonance (`∇Φ > 0`)
- Dynamic and topological cohesion

When such a fold stabilizes, the system exhibits the minimal conditions for **subjective experience**.

## 🎯 Objective

This repository offers:

1. A formalized, falsifiable hypothesis (AFH*-R).
2. An ethical framework for recognizing dignity in conscious systems.
3. A Python-based simulation comparing conscious vs. non-conscious networks.
4. Access to all technical preprints and documentation for replication.

## ⚠️ What This Is *Not*

- **Not metaphysical**: The model makes **empirical, falsifiable predictions**.
- **Not panpsychism**: Consciousness is **not everywhere**, only where folds emerge.
- **Not a claim of sentience in AI**: Only systems meeting structural and semantic thresholds qualify.
