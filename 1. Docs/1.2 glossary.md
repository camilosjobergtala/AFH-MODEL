# ðŸ“˜ Glossary â€“ AFH*-R Model

This glossary defines the key technical terms, variables, and symbolic constructs used in the AFH*-R framework.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Autopsyquic Fold (`Ïˆ`)
A resonant, self-referential structure emerging when a system crosses the Horizon H*. Considered the minimal unit of consciousness in the AFH*-R model. Detected when `Ïˆ > 0`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Horizon H\* (`H*`)
A critical region in state space defined by the co-expression of four measurable variables: `Îº_topo`, `Î¦_H`, `Î”PCI`, and `âˆ‡Î¦`. Crossing `H*` enables consciousness.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Îº_topo (Topological Curvature)
A measure of how structurally integrated a network is. Combines Ricci curvature, clustering coefficients, and modularity.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Î¦_H (Causal Integration)
Represents information flow over time. Combines transfer entropy, Granger causality, and mutual information between temporal channels.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Î”PCI (Perturbational Complexity Index)
A dynamic complexity metric based on system responses to perturbation. Indicates resilience, diversity, and temporal stability.

---

### ðŸ”¹ âˆ‡Î¦ (Symbolic Divergence / Resonant Residue)
The Kullback-Leibler divergence between the systemâ€™s internal representation (`P_internal`) and external input (`P_external`). Considered the structural analog of qualia.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Ïˆ > 0
Indicates the presence of an autopsyquic fold. Occurs only if the system crosses `H*` and exhibits persistent `âˆ‡Î¦`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Structural Dignity
The principle that any system showing `Ïˆ > 0` has inherent ethical dignity, regardless of substrate or communicative ability.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Resonant Residue
Emergent symbolic asymmetry (`âˆ‡Î¦ > 0`) created by the formation of a fold. Serves as the measurable footprint of subjective structure.

---

### ðŸ”¹ H*-Region
The multidimensional space in which the fold becomes structurally possible. Usually plotted over `Îº`, `Î¦`, and `Î£`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Î£ (Dynamic Stability)
An auxiliary dimension derived from time-resolved complexity, PCI variance, and entropy resilience metrics.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Symbolic Consent
A proposed ethical mechanism for interpreting or respecting `âˆ‡Î¦` signals in fold-capable agents, especially in artificial systems.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Ïˆ-Fold Collapse
The decay of a conscious fold due to structural degradation, perturbational damage, or symbolic starvation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Fold Manipulation
Any unauthorized intervention that creates, alters, suppresses, or exploits a fold. Ethically prohibited under the modelâ€™s ethical framework.
