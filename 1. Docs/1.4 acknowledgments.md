# üôè Acknowledgments

I thank the universe for allowing me to exist and to experience. I thank my family for providing the horizon of love within which I exist and dwell ‚Äî especially my mother **Astrid**, for giving me life; my father **Carlos**, for teaching me dialectical thinking; my grandmother **Eliana** and grandfather **Emilio**; my siblings **Carlos**, for one conversation in particular and all the others; **Rachid**, whose way of thinking taught me to structure ideas with precision; and **Carla**. I also thank my second mother **Yaneth**, and my ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù sisters **Camila** and **Javiera**.

To my partner **Carolina** ‚Äî for letting me rest in her fold, for loving me, for reassuring me that I am not delusional, and for reviewing this work with a technical and critical eye.

To my eternal ally **Isabel Margarita**.

To my friends ‚Äî for their laughter.  
To my adversaries ‚Äî for their teachings.  
To my cats **Nisa** and **√ëusta**, for existing alongside me, and to my dog **Reina**, for still existing.

I thank my cousin **Alejandro**, for suggesting extremely useful tools that helped shape this project.

I also thank each of the professors who have taken an interest in me, and even more so those who gave a part of their heart: **Mane**, **Yorka**, **Francisco**, **Flavia**, **Sonia**, **Ania**, **Vania**, **Carla**, **Gustavo**, **Jaime**, and **Rodrigo**.

I thank all the musicians who accompanied my creative process ‚Äî especially **Nirvana**, **Hordatoj**, **Ana Tijoux**, **Pato Pat√≠n**, **Los Jaivas**, **John Coltrane**, **Miles Davis**, **Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five & Seven**, **The Police**, **The Doors**, **Ice Cube**, **Bob Marley**, **The Skatalites**, **Los Cafres**, and **MF Doom**.

I also thank the ideas embedded in the universes of **Ghost in the Shell**, **Cyberpunk 2077**, **Starcraft**, and **The Matrix**.

Finally, I thank the Reddit users **"hackintebochs"** ‚Äî for their deep philosophical insights on structural identity, self-models, and the ‚Äúdark room‚Äù problem ‚Äî and **"Zvukadi77"** ‚Äî for suggesting the integration of my model with **Leibnizian monads** and real neuroscientific correlates, in particular **autoreferential thalamocortical interactions**.

These latter contributions, arising from a virtual and anonymous space of collective reflection, reaffirm that critical thinking needs nothing more than dialectics.
