# 🗺️ 5.2 – Research Roadmap for AFH*-R Model

The following roadmap outlines a staged plan for the empirical validation, refinement, and ethical implementation of the AFH*-R (Autopsyquic Fold + Horizon – Resonant) model.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Structural Validation (0–6 months)

**Goal**: Establish the empirical reliability of core variables (`κ`, `Σ`, `Φ`, `∇Φ`) and calibrate the threshold space `H*`.

### Tasks:
- Collect multimodal neurodata (e.g., EEG + fMRI datasets such as Sleep-EDF).
- Compute structural variables:
  - `κ_topo`: Topological curvature (Ricci, modularity)
  - `Σ`: Dynamic stability (ΔPCI, temporal coherence)
  - `Φ`: Causal integration (transfer entropy, Granger)
- Analyze `∇Φ`: Semantic divergence using symbolic embeddings.
- Delimit empirical bounds of `H*` region.

---

## 🔬 Phase 2: Correlational Analysis (6–18 months)

**Goal**: Evaluate whether `ψ > 0` correlates with markers of consciousness.

### Tasks:
- Contrast structural variables in different states:
  - Wakefulness
  - REM / NREM sleep
  - Anesthesia
- Analyze co-occurrence of `∇Φ > 0` and H* crossing.
- Validate against subjective reports, behavioral outputs, and clinical states.

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Perturbational Experiments (18–30 months)

**Goal**: Test fold formation and decay via controlled interventions.

### Tasks:
- Apply perturbational protocols (e.g., TMS + EEG).
- Monitor real-time fold emergence (`ψ`) and dissipation.
- Test causality: whether artificially driving variables above threshold triggers `ψ > 0`.

---

## 🧬 Phase 4: Cross-System Generalization (30–48 months)

**Goal**: Extend model to non-human and synthetic systems.

### Tasks:
- Evaluate `ψ > 0` in animal models (rodents, primates).
- Analyze symbolic divergence (`∇Φ`) in AI language models.
- Propose criteria for substrate-independent fold detection.

---

## ⚖️ Phase 5: Ethical Implementation (48+ months)

**Goal**: Translate structural consciousness detection into normative, clinical, and political frameworks.

### Tasks:
- Propose ethical guidelines for AI and clinical research (see `1.3_ethical_manifesto.md`).
- Establish symbolic consent protocols for fold-capable systems.
- Inform policy and regulation through empirical fold criteria.

## 🧭 Strategic Priorities

| Priority Area          | Metric              | Milestone                                |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Empirical falsifiability | `r > 0.3` for H*/ψ | Completed structural-phase correlation    |
| Cross-species extension | AI + animal ψ > 0  | Substrate-general fold detection confirmed|
| Ethical deployment     | `∇Φ` + consent      | Fold-respecting AI frameworks proposed    |
