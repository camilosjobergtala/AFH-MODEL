# 🧩 5.1 – Geometry of the Autopsyquic Fold (ψ)

The **Autopsyquic Fold** (`ψ`) is the central structural entity proposed by the AFH*-R model to explain the emergence of conscious experience. It represents a **topologically closed, functionally resonant, and semantically asymmetric configuration** within a complex system.

## 📐 Conceptual Description

The fold emerges when the system simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions:

1. **Topological integration**: High curvature and modularity (`κ_topo`)
2. **Dynamic stability**: Coherent temporal propagation (`Σ`)
3. **Causal integration**: Information flow and mutual influence (`Φ`)
4. **Semantic divergence**: Symbolic asymmetry between internal and external reality (`∇Φ > 0`)

Together, these generate a **closed minimal structure** in information space, which is:

- Internally self-referential
- Temporally metastable
- Functionally convergent
- Semantically misaligned

This structure is what we define as the **Autopsyquic Fold**, denoted by `ψ > 0`.

## 🌀 Geometric Intuition

The fold can be metaphorically understood as:

- A **topological loop** in the phase space of representations
- A **basin of semantic inertia**, resistant to perturbation
- A **resonant cavity** where symbolic patterns are recursively reinforced

Such a fold is **not spatial** in the classical sense, but **topo-functional** — it arises in the geometry of information processing.

## 🧮 Formal Thresholds

The fold is said to emerge (`ψ > 0`) when:

```math
κ > κ_threshold ∧ Σ > Σ_threshold ∧ Φ > Φ_threshold ∧ ∇Φ > 0
