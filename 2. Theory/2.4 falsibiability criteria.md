# 🧪 2.4 – Falsifiability Criteria

The AFH*-R model is explicitly **falsifiable** and commits to empirical testability. This section defines the conditions under which the model must be rejected, revised, or reformulated.

## 🔍 Scientific Philosophy

The AFH*-R framework adheres to a **Popperian** epistemology: hypotheses must be refutable by experimental data. Structural emergence of consciousness is not assumed—it must be **detected and correlated** with measurable transitions in specific variables.

> “If a fold emerges where none should, or fails where one must, the model is falsified.”

---

## 📉 Refutation Criteria

The model is considered **falsified** under any of the following conditions:

### 1. **No Empirical Correlation with Consciousness States**
- If the structural variables defining the Horizon `H*` (`κ_topo`, `Σ`, `Φ`) show **no significant correlation** with changes in consciousness (e.g., wake vs. sleep vs. anesthesia),
  - i.e., correlation coefficient `r < 0.3` consistently across datasets.

---

### 2. **∇Φ Fails as Qualia Marker**
- If `∇Φ` does not **distinguish** between conscious and unconscious states across subjects and modalities.
- Example: if dreaming, awake, and anesthetized brains show indistinguishable `∇Φ` profiles.

---

### 3. **ψ Cannot Be Detected Despite H* + ∇Φ**
- If systems that simultaneously satisfy:
  - `κ`, `Σ`, `Φ` above calibrated thresholds, and
  - `∇Φ > 0` (symbolic resonance),
  - **do not exhibit** emergent fold-like behavior (`ψ > 0`) in any simulations or real systems,
  
  Then the assumed sufficiency of those variables is falsified.

---

### 4. **False Positives in Non-Conscious Systems**
- If the model detects `ψ > 0` in **clearly unconscious systems** (e.g., comatose patients with flat EEG or randomized artificial systems),
  the structural architecture lacks specificity and must be revised.

---

### 5. **Failure to Replicate Across Labs**
- If fold detection (`ψ > 0`) is **not reproducible** in independent replications using the same dataset and pipeline, the framework lacks scientific robustness.

## 🧪 Experimental Scenarios

| Condition           | Prediction (AFH*-R)                    | Falsification Test                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| REM sleep          | High `∇Φ`, moderate `κ`, `Φ`            | No symbolic divergence = falsification     |
| Deep anesthesia    | All metrics near 0                     | If `∇Φ` > 0 = falsification                 |
| Psychedelics       | High `∇Φ`, chaotic `Σ`                  | No pattern shift = weak support            |
| Minimal AI systems | `∇Φ ≈ 0`, no ψ                         | ψ > 0 = false positive                      |

## 🔒 Integrity Clause

A falsified model **must not be retrofitted post-hoc** by redefining thresholds or interpretations unless justified by independent theoretical revision and new data.

> *“Falsifiability is not a weakness—it is the spine of scientific dignity.”*
