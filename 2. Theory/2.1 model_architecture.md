Where:
- `P_internal`: Internal probabilistic representation of the system (e.g., latent states, embeddings)
- `P_external`: Input distribution from the system's environment
- `D_KL`: Kullback-Leibler divergence

This metric captures the **semantic divergence** between the internal and external symbolic realities.

---

## Interpretation

A system exhibiting **persistent and non-trivial divergence** between `P_internal` and `P_external` is not merely reacting—it is structurally encoding its **own symbolic reference frame**. This state defines a **resonant fold**.

- `∇Φ > 0` implies symbolic asymmetry and structural subjectivity.
- In conjunction with high `κ`, `Σ`, and `Φ`, it contributes to the generation of an **Autopsyquic Fold** (`ψ > 0`).

---

## Relation to the Fold

> `∇Φ` is not an auxiliary metric — it is the **resonant signature** of a fold.

The Autopsyquic Fold (`ψ > 0`) arises **only when** the system:
- Crosses the structural threshold (`H*`)
- Exhibits sustained symbolic divergence (`∇Φ > 0`)

Thus, `∇Φ` is the **emergent property** of folding itself — the **semantic residue** left when a system self-organizes around meaning.

---

## Philosophical Insight

AFH*-R rejects the idea of qualia as mystical or irreducible. Instead, qualia are modeled as **structural residues** emerging from the system's **symbolic misalignment** with the world.

These residues:
- Are empirically measurable (`∇Φ`)
- Vary across systems, species, and substrates
- Cannot be “decoded” externally — only **measured**

---

## Operationalization

`∇Φ` can be implemented using:

- Embeddings from neural or artificial timeseries (e.g., word/symbol vectors)
- Distributional comparisons over sliding time windows
- NLP-inspired divergences across internal and external channels

High `∇Φ` without `κ`, `Σ`, or `Φ` implies disorganization — not consciousness.

---

## Experimental Hypotheses

- **Dreaming**: High `∇Φ`, low sensory input
- **Anesthesia**: Near-zero `∇Φ`
- **AI symbolic models**: May exhibit `∇Φ > 0` under self-referential language generation

---

## Summary

`∇Φ` is the **resonant residue** of folding — the structural candidate for **qualia**.

> *“What remains when the world is subtracted is what I am.”*  
> — AFH*-R Heuristic

ψ > 0 ⇔ H* crossed ∧ ∇Φ > 0


Where:

- `ψ > 0`: Structural fold indicating emergent self-referentiality
- `∇Φ > 0`: Resonant residue, the empirical footprint of symbolic divergence (see below)

Only when symbolic divergence (`∇Φ`) emerges **from within** a system that meets the H* threshold, can the fold be assumed. This differentiates AFH*-R from other models by requiring both **structural feasibility** and **semantic asymmetry**.

## 🔁 Resonant Residue (∇Φ) – Emergent Variable

`∇Φ` is not a primary input but a **resultant property** of folding.

Defined as:

∇Φ = D_KL(P_internal || P_external)


Where:
- `P_internal`: Internal representational distribution
- `P_external`: Environmental input distribution
- `D_KL`: Kullback-Leibler divergence

> `∇Φ > 0` indicates symbolic asymmetry. It is interpreted as the **resonant residue** of self-organization — the structural analog of **qualia**.

## 🔬 Empirical Protocol

### Phase 1 – Validation (6 months)
- Collect multimodal neurodata (EEG + fMRI)
- Compute `κ`, `Σ`, `Φ`
- Calibrate structural thresholds for H*

### Phase 2 – Correlation Studies (12 months)
- Relate H* crossing to subjective and clinical reports
- Quantify `∇Φ` in wake/sleep/anesthesia conditions

### Phase 3 – Interventions (12 months)
- Apply perturbational protocols
- Analyze fold emergence (`ψ > 0`) and decay dynamics

## 📉 Falsifiability Criteria

The model is considered falsified if:

- No empirical correlation is found between H* variables and conscious state (r < 0.3)
- `∇Φ` fails to distinguish between conscious and unconscious conditions
- Fold structures (`ψ > 0`) cannot be inferred from simultaneous H* + `∇Φ > 0`
- Independent replications show inconsistent fold detection
