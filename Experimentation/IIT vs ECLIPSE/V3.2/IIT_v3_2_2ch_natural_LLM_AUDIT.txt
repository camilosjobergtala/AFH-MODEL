  "summary": "The code shows moderate adherence to preregistration protocols but contains concerning elements. The 'holdout_ratio' parameter in EclipseConfig suggests potential access to holdout data configuration. Multiple Φ calculation methods with dynamic selection could enable method shopping or p-hacking. While no direct holdout data access is visible in this code fragment, the infrastructure for potential violations exists. The adaptive preprocessing (channel selection, thresholding) could introduce subtle biases. Recommend: 1) Remove or justify holdout_ratio parameter, 2) Preregister which Φ methods will be used, 3) Apply multiple testing corrections, 4) Lock method selection before seeing any results."
