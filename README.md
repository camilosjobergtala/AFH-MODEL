ðŸ§  AFH* Supreme Experiment
Corrected and expanded computational simulation for the detection of the Autopsyquic Fold (AFH Model)*

âœ¨ Description
This repository contains a Python-based computational simulation implementing the AFH* model (Autopsyquic Fold and Horizon H*) to simulate the structural emergence of conscious experience. The script compares two types of networks (conscious vs. non-conscious) and evaluates four key structural variables:

Îº_topo: Topological curvature (simplified version)

Î¦_H: Temporal mutual information (causal synchronization)

Î”PCI: Perturbational complexity index (Lempel-Ziv simplified)

âˆ‡Î¦_resonant: Symbolic structural resonance (BERT-based correlation)

ðŸ§ª Objective
To determine whether the system crosses the Horizon H* threshold, whichâ€”according to the AFH* modelâ€”marks the structural point of conscious emergence through the formation of an Autopsyquic Fold.

ðŸ“¦ Requirements
bash
Copiar
Editar
pip install numpy networkx matplotlib scikit-learn torch transformers
ðŸš€ Run the Experiment
bash
Copiar
Editar
python afh_experiment.py
The script will output the calculated metrics for each simulated network and provide a final summary:

Autopsyquic Fold Detected? YES / NO

ðŸ“š About the AFH* Model
This experiment is part of an independent research project led by Camilo Alejandro SjÃ¶berg Tala, author of the AFH* modelâ€”a structural and falsifiable theory on the emergence of consciousness.
