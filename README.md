# 🧠 AFH* MODEL – Simulation of Consciousness Emergence

Welcome to the official repository of the **AFH\*** model: a falsifiable and structural hypothesis for the **emergence of consciousness** through the formation of an **Autopsyquic Fold** (PAH\*) once a critical topological threshold is crossed – the **Horizon H\***.

This repository contains the Python implementation of the **AFH\* Supreme Experiment**, a simulation to test whether a system meets the minimal structural requirements for conscious experience.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Autopsyquic Fold (PAH\*)**: A closed, self-referential and resonant structure in the system's network topology, representing the minimal unit of subjective experience.
- **Horizon H\***: The threshold of structural organization that must be crossed for a pliegue autopsíquico to emerge.
- **Key measurable variables**:
  - `κ_topo`: Topological curvature
  - `Φ_H`: Temporal mutual information
  - `ΔPCI`: Perturbational complexity index
  - `∇Φ_resonant`: Symbolic neural resonance

## 🧪 What does the simulation do?

This Python script compares a **conscious** vs. a **non-conscious** network system by:

1. Generating two artificial networks with different levels of connectivity.
2. Simulating timeseries and perturbations.
3. Calculating the 4 structural indicators.
4. Printing results and determining whether the Autopsyquic Fold is detected.
